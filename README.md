# monopoly-object-calisthenics-ruby

Despite the rather long name, this repository is an experiment in solving a programming assignment using the 9 rules of object calisthenics. Instead of Java, the language of choice is Ruby.

## Object Calisthenics 

Introduced by Jeff Bay in [The ThoughtWorks Anthology](http://pragprog.com/book/twa/thoughtworks-anthology), the set of rules are:

1. Use only one level of indentation per method.
2. Don’t use the else keyword.
3. Wrap all primitives and strings.
4. Use only one dot per line.
5. Don’t abbreviate.
6. Keep all entities small.
7. Don’t use any classes with more than two instance variables.
8. Don’t use any getters/setters/properties.
9. Use first-class collections.
